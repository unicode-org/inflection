/**
 * @brief Facilitates the creation of _Concepts_
 * @details Concepts can generally be defined as a way to lexically represent real-world or linguistic ideas. These ideas can
 * vary greatly in scope, and range from the representation of a mathematical number by a language, to rules on how to
 * properly affix a suffix to a token in order to represent plurality.
 *
 * You should never instantiate this interface yourself. Instead use CommonConceptFactoryProvider to get an instance
 * of this class for any supported locale.
 *
 * To use this class, it is recommended to use LocalizedCommonConceptFactoryProvider::getDefaultCommonConceptFactoryProvider() to
 * get a LocalizedCommonConceptFactoryProvider singleton, then use
 * CommonConceptFactoryProvider::getCommonConceptFactory() to get a CommonConceptFactory in any supported locale:
 * @code
 * #include <inflection/dialog/LocalizedCommonConceptFactoryProvider.hpp>
 * #include <inflection/dialog/CommonConceptFactory.hpp>
 *
 * auto commonConceptFactory =
 *      inflection::dialog::LocalizedCommonConceptFactoryProvider::getDefaultCommonConceptFactoryProvider()->getCommonConceptFactory(inflection::util::LocaleUtils::PORTUGUESE())
 * @endcode
